# Schwartz-Universal-Values
The Schwartz Universal Values is a set of interculturally validated values that every human recognizes. Every person has their own priority in which values are more important to them, yet all values are present in every person. The 10 values are grouped in four clusters. On average, most people have a preference for one cluster over the others.

# Resources
Description of the value clusters is based on the syllabus ’Basiskennis Vitaliteit’ van Chivo.nl combined with insights from various modules from their Vitality Expert course (Vitaliteitskundige).

A decent short description of the theory in dutch can be found here https://progressiegerichtwerken.nl/waarden-en-wijsheid-hoe-we-wijzer-kunnen-worden/

The descriptions of the 10 values are based on the paper "Moraliteitontwikkeling en de 10 waardentheorie van Schwartz - scriptie_J_Kleyweg" which is archived under the resources folder.

Want to fill out a test to get your personal values and more, a good, concise test is available in DUTCH at https://chivo.nl/idplein/ (note this is not a full comprehensive test but if you fill it out honestly, it does provide some valuable insights you could work with by yourself, with a coach or your team).
