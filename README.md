# Schwartz-Universal-Values
The Schwartz Universal Values is a set of interculturally validated values that every human recognizes. Every person has their own priority in which values are more important to them, yet all values are present in every person. The 10 values are grouped in four clusters. On average, most people have a preference for one cluster over the others.
